          <h3>Why I started</h3>
          <p>I started youtube because I wanted to take my creativity and post it to other people. When I started my very first channel KetNickLexKy in 2013 I had lots of fun. In 2015 I started a new channel called Twitchy33! I only posted vlogs at the time but I wanted to do something more fun I decided to start maing gamining videos and people loved it. That is why I started and what I do now!</P>
