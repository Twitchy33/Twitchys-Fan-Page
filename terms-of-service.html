            <p>Through the Service, you may have the opportunity to join a Group (as defined below). The individual or entity controlling or owning the email address for a Group will be deemed the owner of the Group for all purposes (the "Owner"). The Owner may choose (in that person’s sole discretion) to make a different person the new Owner (in such case the new owner shall be considered the Owner). If the Owner’s account is terminated pursuant to these Terms, Bloxyland may, in its sole business judgment, determine who is the rightful person to be made the new Owner of the Group (and that user shall be considered the Owner); provided, however, that nothing will obligate Bloxyland to designate a new Owner if Roblox in its sole business judgment determines to terminate a Group. By participating in a Group, you hereby grant the Owner of the Group, as such Owner may change over time, the sole and exclusive authority to act on your behalf to authorize Bloxyland to use any UGC created by the Group as set forth in these Terms or pursuant to any other agreement entered into between the Owner and Bloxyland. An Owner and the members of a Group may separately agree upon how the Owner may exercise the authority granted to such Owner in these Terms or how the members of a Group may allocate amongst themselves any payments that may be made to the Owner for any activities undertaken or UGC created by the Group, but in any event Bloxyland will make any payments due for any activities undertaken or UGC created by the Group solely to the Owner of the Group. You hereby waive any claims that you may have against Bloxyland for any payments made to an Owner by Bloxyland, and you agree to seek recovery of any payments due you solely from the Owner of any Group of which you are a member. Except as may be provided at law, any duty of accounting between an Owner of a Group and members of such Group will arise solely pursuant to a written agreement among the Owner of a Group and its members, and Bloxyland will not be bound by any agreement among the Owner and members. Any reference to "you" in this Section 6 shall, in the case of a Group, only mean the Owner.  A "Group" exists where users or Devs have joined together to register as a group, via a single email address, on the Service in order to release a game or content via the Service. For corporate Accounts, the company (or other legal entity) named on the Account is considered to be a Group.</p>
